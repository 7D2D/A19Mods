A proof of concept, unfinished, modlet that demonstrates how to implement melee weapon modifiers.  New hidef textures and mesh fixes provided by Dust2Death. Those textures were reduced to 1K for compatibility with most PCs. Hopefully other modders will want to make some more attachments for this mod and collaborate to make it a more finished modlet.  
Thanks to DukeW74 for the schematic Icons!
